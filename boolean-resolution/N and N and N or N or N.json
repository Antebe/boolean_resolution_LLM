So, that part of the request is satisfied.\n\nHowever, Andre also mentioned Mango and Pear, which Boris did not buy. This part of the request is not satisfied.\n\nAndre listed Durian as an alternative option, and Boris bought Durian. Therefore, this part of the request is satisfied.\n\nAndre also listed Lychee as an alternative option, and Boris bought Lychee. So, this part of the request is satisfied.\n\nOverall, Boris met Andre's request partly, as he bought Cherry, Durian, and Lychee, but he did not buy Mango and Pear. Oversatisfaction is allowed, so the presence of Durian and Lychee does not affect the satisfaction of the request.\n\nTherefore, Boris met Andre's request.\n\nAnswer: 1"
