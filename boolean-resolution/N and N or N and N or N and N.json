Grape and Mango\n2. Coconut and Elderberry\n3. Papaya and Lime\n\nFrom Boris's purchases, we can see that he bought Lime and Papaya (completing request 3), Elderberry and Coconut (completing request 2), and Mango (from request 1). Boris did not buy Grape or Coconut, which are part of Andre's requests. However, we are allowed to have oversatisfaction, so even though Grape and Coconut were not requested, they were not required for a match. Therefore, Boris did meet Andre's request with oversatisfaction.\n\nThe answer is: 1"
